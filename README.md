## Time Calculation for Each Task

Task time tracking is a core feature of TaskRadar:

- Each task maintains a `timeLogs` array, where each log includes a `start` and `end` timestamp, and an optional `pauseReason`.
- Total time spent on a task is automatically calculated as the sum of all `(end - start)` intervals.
- When a task is paused, the current time log ends, and the pause reason is recorded.
- When resumed, a new time log is started.
- The `totalTimeSpent` field reflects the cumulative active work time, excluding paused intervals.
